# Contributing to NewerHoods

:+1::tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

There are many ways in which you can contribute to this project. The following is a set of guildelines to help you contribute to NewerHoods. These aren’t rules but just some ideas to get you started.

## Contribute with Data
You can submit datasets you think might be an interesting/valuable addition to   NewerHoods. You can send us a `csv` file with the processed data which are ideally a set of features for each census tract (2010 definitions). We would love if you could send us some information about the data and the analysis behind it, all the pre-processing and cleaning steps for example. 

## Contribute with Code
You can also contribute with code that improves our methodology, performance or the UI of the app. Do feel free to reach out to us at dataclinic@twosigma.com if you want to discuss about the new features you want to build. Keep an eye out for issues on GitHub where you can find ways to contribute to this project with code. We will label issues so that it is easy for anyone new to start contributing with smaller fixes. When sending us code, please submit a pull request with a clear description of the changes you’ve made. 

## GitHub issues
Feel free to use issues on GitHub to submit bug reports, suggest enhancements, and improve our documentation. 

## Feedback
Lastly, just your feedback on the app is valuable to us. You can use this [form](https://airtable.com/shr2sLGHHIiLY6BUC) to submit your thoughts and ideas on how we could make this work better for you or just to stay in the loop as we develop and launch new features.
